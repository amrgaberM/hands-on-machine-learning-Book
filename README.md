## Learning Methodology

My approach to working through this book emphasizes depth over speed:

**Theoretical Understanding**: I thoroughly read each chapter before implementing code, ensuring I understand the mathematical foundations and conceptual frameworks behind each algorithm.

**Practical Implementation**: Rather than simply copying provided code, I implement algorithms from scratch when possible, then compare with library implementations to understand optimization techniques.

**Experimentation**: I modify parameters, try different datasets, and explore edge cases to develop intuition about when and why different approaches work.

**Documentation**: I maintain detailed notes on key insights, common pitfalls, and practical considerations for each technique.

**Validation**: I test implementations on multiple datasets and validate results against established benchmarks to ensure correctness.
